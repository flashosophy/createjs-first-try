# createjs-first-try
My first attempt with createjs. You can see it live at http://vitapoly.com.
The website consists of some products and services Vitapoly provides.

There is a cross-domain issue when running locally so I recommend either running it on the web or with a web server. Tip: If there are no errors and mouse events do not work, then it's a cross-domain issue.
